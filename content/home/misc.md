### <u>Research Interest</u>

Data mining and knowledge discovery **algorithms, systems, applications**, 
and their implications to decision process and policy-making. Specifically, my interests are:

1. proposing fundamental **algorithms** to tackle complex problems, including anomaly detection, ensemble learning, and clustering.
2. designing scalable machine learning **systems** with performance optimization instruments, e.g., parallelization and JIT.
3. marrying data mining with other areas (such as healthcare and finance) to build **applications** and understand their **implications** to decision making, public policy, social welfare, and society as a whole.


### <u>Fun Facts</u>

I am a dedicated technical writer with more than 200 articles (in Chinese) and 75,000 followers on [Zhihu (知乎)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhihu), 
also known as Chinese Quora with more them 200 million registered users. 
I have been recognized as a Top Zhihu Writer (优秀回答者) in four fields (AI, ML, DM, and STAT). See my [Zhihu page](https://www.zhihu.com/people/breaknever/).
