I am an incoming Ph.D. student at H. John Heinz III College, Carnegie Mellon University (Fall 2019). 
I will be part of [Data Analytics Techniques Algorithms (DATA) Lab](https://datalab.heinz.cmu.edu/) directed by 
[Prof. Leman Akoglu](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/lakoglu/). 
My research focuses on data mining algorithms and applications, specifically on outlier & anomaly detection, ensemble learning, and clustering.
